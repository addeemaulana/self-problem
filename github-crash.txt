### Problem if you want to create new repository and want to remote and then push from local to online repository :
        To https://github.com/addeemaulana/personal-apps.git
         ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
        error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/addeemaulana/personal-apps.git'
        hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
        hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
        hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
        hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
